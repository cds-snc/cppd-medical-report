# Canada Pension Plan Disability (CPPD) - Medical Report (Form ISP-2519)

**Demo (`master` branch):** https://cppdmedicalreport-appservice.azurewebsites.net/

[ESDC](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) and [CDS](https://digital.canada.ca) are working together to make [CPPD](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit.html) better. We're focused on finding ways to shrink end-to-end processing time without decreasing the quality of decisions. We're currently building a prototype of the CPPD Medical Report as a way to explore some hypotheses and potentially make more of this process online.
